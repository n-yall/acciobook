# Acciobook: An Accessible Audiobook Player for People with Language Impairments

An accessible audiobook player designed for individuals with languague impairments. "Acciobook" is an audiobook player whose name combines "accio ðŸª„" and "audiobook ðŸ“š," representing a goal to bring the joy of reading back into their daily lives. This project focuses on enhancing accessibility, usability, and inclusivity for audiobook users.

## Features

- **Speed Control**: Adjust playback speed, ranging from 0.5x to 2.0x.  
- **Segment Pause**: Insert pauses between segments to create natural breaks for better comprehension.  
- **Jump Back/Forward**: Navigate between segments with backward and forward controls.

## Note

This project originally utilized a Django-based backend API to fetch audiobook data. However, the version uploaded to this GitHub repository has been modified to operate independently by directly accessing local MP3 and JSON files for audiobook content and metadata. This change ensures ease of use and portability for demonstration purposes without requiring a server setup.
